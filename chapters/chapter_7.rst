Bluetooth Anuduino Interfacing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Overview of the Experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bluetooth communication has become one of the most widely 
used methods when it comes to data transfer. In this 
experiment we have interfaced a bluetooth module with an
anuduino board to control the led.

We have used HC06 bluetooth module.This module works on 
3.3 V supply.The TX pin on the bluetooth module is directly 
connected to RX on ATtiny85 and the TX on ATtiny85 is 
connected to 50 ohm which is connected to 100 ohm and RX 
on the ATtiny85.The other end of 100 ohm is connected to 
the ground.(Since HC-06 module is not available on fritzing 
we have used another module RN-42 to represent HC-06)

The commands to control the led is sent through the 
'BlueTerm +' app on the android(The application is available
on google playstore).
BlueTerm + has to be downloaded and installed on the phone for 
this project.

Zigbee Interfacing with Anuduino
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Overview of the Experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In earlier days the application of the wireless technology was limited mostly 
to simple point to point communication only replacing the cable based 
communication systems. The entire communication system itself became complex 
after the introduction of the computer and communication system based on 
computers. Several complex networked communication systems like LAN, WAN, 
PAN etc. came into use. To replace the cable based network communication system 
with wireless technology demands the design of complex wireless devices and 
wireless network protocols. The ZigBee is the name of a wireless protocol 
maintained by the IEEE 802.15 standard. This is a protocol specified for 
wireless Personal Area Network (PAN) using low powered wireless transceivers. 
There are already wireless transmitter and receiver modules which can do point to
point communication. The Xbee is the brand name a wireless transceiver device 
introduced by the Digi international which works on the ZigBeeprotocol and can 
form PAN networks. They have an approximate range of 10 to 100 meters and are 
used in industries, scientific fields, medical fields etc.
The Xbee module even though uses complex packet data based Zigbee protocol for
communicating with each other, they can communicate with other devices using 
simplest serial communication protocol and hence they are widely used in 
microcontroller base boards. This tutorial demonstrates how to interface an 
Xbee module with the Arduino board and perform simple transmission and reception.
This is a very basic experiment with the Xbee using only two Xbee modules in which 
one of them transmit the data and another one receives data but controlled using 
the Anuduino board. In this experiment we have shown zigbee communication using 
anuduino.We have used one anuduino board and two xbee modules,one configured as 
coordinator and the other as receiver using XCTU software.At sender side a switch 
is connected to the anuduino.If the switch is closed,the anuduino sends a signal 
via the xbee which energizes a relay at the receiver side and the led glows.If 
switch is open,the signal sent via zigbee turns off the led. The configuration 
of the XBees was done using the X-CTU software.The coordinator XBee was
configured to be in API mode and the router XBee to AT mode.The PAN IDs SHOULD be the
same for both and enable JV for the router XBee.

Serial: Accelerometer using single wire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Overview of the Experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration. The proper 
acceleration measured by an accelerometer is not necessarily the coordinate 
acceleration (rate of change of velocity). Instead, the accelerometer sees the 
acceleration associated with the phenomenon of weight experienced by any test 
mass at rest in the frame of reference of the accelerometer device. In this 
experiment we have interfaced an accelerometer ADXL335 with an anuduino board.

The ADXL335 is a small, thin, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with 
signal conditioned voltage outputs. The product measures acceleration with a 
minimum full-scale range of Â±3g.It can measure the static acceleration of gravity 
in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, 
shock, or vibration.

In this experiment,we are using single-wire communication.By declaring a 
<SoftSerial> object with the same pin for Tx and Rx,it is possible to use a 
half duplex (request/response) software serial port using a single I/O. The 
external interface is composed of 2 resistors and a regular diode.This approach 
allows to use the built-in Serial Monitor of the arduino IDE to view the values 
obtained from the experiment.It should be noted that a RS232 port is required 
for this purpose.
